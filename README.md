# X-Ray-Pneumonia-Detection


Pneumonia is an inflammatory condition that mainly impacts the lungs, and it comes with a range of symptoms like coughing, chest pain, fever, and trouble breathing. This project aims to create an automated system that can detect and classify pneumonia in medical images.

Motivation
The driving force behind this project is to harness the power of artificial intelligence to accurately identify and classify pneumonia in individuals using chest X-ray images. By automating the diagnostic process, we can help healthcare professionals deliver timely and precise treatment.

Approach
To build an AI system capable of detecting pneumonia, we used transfer learning techniques. The system is based on ResNet architectures and was developed using Python and TensorFlow. For efficient training and evaluation of the models, we utilized Google Colab GPU and TensorBoard.

Key Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow
- Python Libraries

The Dataset
The dataset for this project is neatly organized into three folders: train, test, and val. It includes X-ray images (JPEG) sorted into two categories: Pneumonia and Normal.


We can use this type of prediction system and can deploy it on a large scale to facilitate the doctors.
